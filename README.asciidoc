= JDK9 Jigsaw Module JDK Enumerator
Benjamin Schmid <benjamin.schmid@exxcellent.de>

This little project tries to enumerate all JDK 12 accessible symbols and build a
word list as spell checker dictionary.

This project uses the great work of the
link:https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph[classgraph project]

== Usage

Point your JDK to the desired JDK12 and simply start the application


    export JDK_HOME=/path/to/jdk12/
    ./gradle run


=== Adding newly added modules (JDK13+)

The application relies, that you declare the JDK default modules as `requires`
dependency in the `src/main/java/module-info.java`. You can obtain a full list
of the JDK observable modules via

    java --list-modules
